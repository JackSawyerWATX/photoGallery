        <h1>Airplanes of the Battle of Britian</h1>
        <h4>
            The Battle of Britain, which raged between July and October 1940, pitted the Royal Air Force against the
            German Luftwaffe in a duel for air superiority over southern England. Pilots on both sides were at the
            controls of some of the most iconic aircraft in aviation history, including the Spitfire, Hurricane and
            Messerschmitt Bf 109.
            <br><br>
            Here are 9 iconic aircraft of the Battle of Britain:

            <p>
                The Spitfire was the iconic aircraft of the Battle of Britain and became the
                symbol of British defiance in the air. Designed by Reginald Mitchell, it had an
                advanced all-metal airframe, making it light and strong. It took longer to build
                than the Hurricane and was less sturdy, but it was faster and had a
                responsiveness which impressed all who flew it. Crucially, it was a match for
                the Luftwaffe’s Messerschmitt Bf 109 and was superior to it at lower altitudes.
                The Spitfire entered service with No. 19 Squadron at Duxford in August 1938.
                Production was slow at first, but by September 1940 it was in service with 18
                RAF squadrons. Spitfires shot down a total of 529 enemy aircraft, for a loss of
                230 of their own.

            <p>
                The Hurricane was the most numerous of RAF Fighter Command’s aircraft
                during the Battle of Britain, equipping 33 squadrons by September 1940. Its
                traditional design - a wood and metal framework covered in fabric - was
                derived from earlier biplane fighters and was essentially out of date despite
                later improvements. However, it was a stable and rugged aircraft that could be
                maintained and repaired more easily than the Spitfire. Its limitations meant
                that, where possible, Hurricane squadrons were directed against enemy
                bombers while the superior Spitfires dealt with the fighter escorts. Despite its
                shortcomings, the Hurricane accounted for 656 German aircraft during the
                Battle of Britain - more than the Spitfire. Between 30 July and 16 September,
                404 Hurricanes were destroyed.

            <figcaption>Boulton Paul Defiant</figcaption>
            <p>
                The Defiant was a two-seat fighter with a four-gun power-operated turret. It
                had no forward firing armament, which meant it could not shoot down enemy
                aircraft from behind. It was intended primarily as a bomber interceptor, but the
                turret fighter concept was outmoded and the extra weight made the aircraft
                sluggish in combat. In early battles over Dunkirk, Defiants had proved very
                vulnerable to conventional enemy fighters. RAF Fighter Command rashly sent
                its two Defiant squadrons - Nos. 141 and 264 - into action in July and August,
                which resulted in two separate massacres at the hands of the Luftwaffe. As a
                consequence the aircraft played no further part as a day fighter in the Battle.

            <p>
                The Bf 109 was arguably the best fighter in the world in 1940. It was faster
                than the Spitfire at high altitude, could dive more rapidly and carried a more
                effective armament of two cannon and two machine guns. Most Bf 109 pilots
                had more combat experience than their RAF counterparts, at least at first,
                which also conferred a major advantage. However, the Messerschmitt did not
                have the range to fly beyond London and carried only seven seconds worth of
                cannon ammunition, which limited its operational usefulness. The Luftwaffe
                started the Battle with about 1,100 Bf 109s and 906 pilots available. Some 650
                aircraft were shot down.

            <p>
                The two-seat Bf 110 was designed as a long-range heavy escort fighter
                or Zerstörer (destroyer). It was fast and well-armed, but lacked
                manoeuvrability. It was markedly inferior to the more nimble RAF fighters and
                became a liability when attempting to guard the bomber formations. The
                Germans were forced to use Bf 109s to escort the Bf 110s. However, the
                aircraft was more effective when used for low-level attacks against factories
                and RAF airfields. The Germans failed to see the potential of the Bf 110 in this
                fighter-bomber role and only one Luftwaffe unit was trained for such work.

            <p>
                The He 111 was the most important of the Luftwaffe's early bombers, but was
                obsolescent in 1940. Its bomb load of 2,000 kg was insufficient for a strategic
                bombing campaign and it was slow and poorly armed. Measures to increase its
                defensive armament proved ineffective and the Heinkel, like other German
                bomber types, was acutely vulnerable to RAF fighter opposition. In its favour
                was a structural strength that could soak up punishment – many aircraft
                managed to return to base with hundreds of bullet holes in their fuselage and
                flying surfaces.

            <p>
                The Dornier Do 17 - nicknamed the ‘Flying Pencil’ - was based on a pre-war
                design for a high speed mail plane, which was converted into a bomber by the
                Nazi air ministry. The Do 17Z became the main production version, equipping
                three Luftwaffe bomber wings at the height of the Battle of Britain. The aircraft
                was already virtually obsolete. It was nimble at low altitude but could only carry
                1,000 kg of bombs and had a limited range. Like the Heinkel He 111, its
                defensive armament was weak and losses were severe. In a famous action
                on 18 August eight Dorniers were shot down and nine damaged in attacks on
                RAF Kenley, to the south of London. Dornier Do 17 production was terminated
                in the summer of 1940.

            <p>
                The Junkers Ju 88 was the most modern of Germany’s bombers in 1940. It was
                designed as a fast medium bomber and first flew in December 1936. However,
                the promising new design was compromised by Ernst Udet, deputy to the
                Luftwaffe’s Commander-in-Chief Hermann Göring. Udet demanded that the Ju 88
                be capable of dive-bombing. The necessary structural changes increased
                the aircraft’s weight, which reduced its performance and also delayed
                production. It proved just as vulnerable to RAF fighters as other Luftwaffe
                bombers during the Battle of Britain, but later matured into one of the most
                versatile and important of the Luftwaffe’s aircraft.

            <p>
                The infamous ‘Stuka’ achieved notoriety during the Blitzkrieg triumphs of
                1939-1940. Its name derived from an abbreviation of the German term for
                dive bomber - Sturzkampffleugzeug. The Ju 87 was the chosen weapon of the
                Luftwaffe High Command, designed to deliver pin-point bombing attacks in a
                near vertical dive. It was effective during the campaigns in Poland and France,
                when German forces operated largely in an environment of air superiority. But
                in the skies over Britain the story was very different. After some initial
                successes by heavily escorted formations, the Stukas were slaughtered by RAF
                fighters. On their worst day, 18 August, 12 Ju 87s were shot down and many
                others damaged or written off in crashes on their return. Such losses meant
                the aircraft was gradually withdrawn from the battle.
